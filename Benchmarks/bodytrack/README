Building:
---------
./configure --enable-threads --enable-tbb

(--enable-tbb should be enough, but somehow it automatically starts building threaded
version too, so it doesn't harm to provide --enable-threads too, to check for pthreads
headers and so on)

make

Running:
--------
The resulting binary is src/TracingBenchmark/bodytrack. It accepts 7 arguments. The
first one is the location of the input data (inputs/inputs1), second and third
have to be 4 and 1 for the inputs/input1, the next to can be set arbitrarily
(larger they are, more time execution takes), the 6th one is threading model (1 for
TBB) and the last one is number of threads. So, an example run (which takes about 30
seconds on lovelace) is

src/TrachingBenchmark/bodytrack inputs/input1 4 1 100000 10 1 4
